"""This is the (**intro** of the) retrieval package doc. It's in the ``__init__.py`` of the package, as an example for the other packages, and IT SHOULD BE cleaned up without all of this ;).

It could contain similar/the same retrieval best practices text.

It might contain, e.g., items in this way

* This

* That

and also code snippets like usual, using as usual these double colons and the indented code::

    retrieval = Retrieval(config)

And that's it.

(In the following I included all the up-to-now available modules, sectioned by the best practices page criteria.)
